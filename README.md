# Flappy Bird With Pygame

## Overview
This is a Flappy Bird game clone made using Pygame. This project was created in 2022 and was one of my first projects working with Pygame. I recreated many of the technical aspects of Flappy Bird and was successful in various aspects. This project uses object-oriented programming (OOP), which helped me learn and apply these concepts.
